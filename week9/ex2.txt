It was 999/1 hit/miss result for all 3 frames the first time in my input. Initially table is empty, so there was only one miss.
The next time in my input there were numbers with different values. It gave my 0/1000 hit/miss result for all 3 frames. All input with different values generates all misses.
So, it means that for increasing hit rate we should add more equal numbers and put them as close as possible.
